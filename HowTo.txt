To run the program do the following:


python3 emptyWrapper.py --> runs empty sim X number of times
                        --> generates brainID.nndf files 
                        --> Writes ID of those files to a txt file                                               bestBrains.txt
                        --> Writes fitnesses of those sims to a txt file                                         emptyEnv_fitnesses.txt

python3 obstacleWrapper.py 
                        --> reads in ID from bestBrains.txt 
                        --> deletes first line in bestBrains.txt
                        --> runs sims using brainID.nndf file in an obstacle environment X number of times
                        --> writes fitnesses of those sims to a txt file                                         obstacleEnv_fitnesses.txt



Use refresh.py to delete unneeded files


change everything from #GUI to DIRECT

For data collection:
Change show_best() in parallelHC from GUI to DIRECT

Change p.GUI to p.DIRECT in MBsimulation

Maybe GUI is too much for computer to simulate. Maybe NEED to do this in DIRECT. --> didn't seem to work in DIRECT either.... maybe just try it with fewer links.

Do direct or GUI simulations give different fitnesses? NO.


Make sure MBsimulate is set up to generate correct number of obstacle blocks.

---------------------------
MBsimulation gets the index of the champion of all 35 bots, and then we find the bestBrains.txt value that corresponds to that index.

--------------------------
I have added the ability to specify the initial x and y positions of each bot. 
I have changed Get_Obstacle_Fitness() in robot.py so that fitness is the displacement from the robot's initial x position
I have learned that the bots are using the same neural network? 
I have commented out the obstacle blocks in order to find out how to separate the neural networks of multiple robots so that when they are run in the same env, they get the same fitness

To Do: Find out how to separate the the neural networks of multiple robots when they're generated in the same environment.
