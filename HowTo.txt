To run the program do the following:


python3 emptyWrapper.py --> runs empty sim X number of times
                        --> generates brainID.nndf files 
                        --> Writes ID of those files to a txt file                                               bestBrains.txt
                        --> Writes fitnesses of those sims to a txt file                                         emptyEnv_fitnesses.txt

python3 obstacleWrapper.py 
                        --> reads in ID from bestBrains.txt 
                        --> deletes first line in bestBrains.txt
                        --> runs sims using brainID.nndf file in an obstacle environment X number of times
                        --> writes fitnesses of those sims to a txt file                                         obstacleEnv_fitnesses.txt



Use refresh.py to delete unneeded files
